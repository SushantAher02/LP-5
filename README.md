# Fashion MNIST CNN Classifier

This project demonstrates a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). The Fashion MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of 10 distinct types of fashion items such as t-shirts, trousers, dresses, and shoes. Each image has dimensions of 28x28 pixels.

## Dataset Overview
Fashion MNIST has 10 categories:
1. T-shirt/top
2. Trouser
3. Pullover
4. Dress
5. Coat
6. Sandal
7. Shirt
8. Sneaker
9. Bag
10. Ankle boot

Each category contains 7,000 images, with 60,000 images in the training set and 10,000 images in the test set. The goal of this project is to build a CNN that can classify these images into their correct categories.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x or later
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## Installation
